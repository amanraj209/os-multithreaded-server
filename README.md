# OS Multithreaded Web Server
In this project repository, a multithreaded web server is implemented in Java to handle concurrent user requests.

This web server's performance to handle multiple requests is evaluated by comparing several scheduling algorithms used
in Operating Systems.
Some common algorithms and a genetic algorithm "Ant Colony Optimization" are tested on this web server.

## How to run
- `git clone https://github.com/amanraj209/os-multithreaded-server.git`
- Run WebServer.java using terminal or any IDE
- Visit localhost:8080
